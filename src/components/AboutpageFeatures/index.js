        With this software, they can store it and mark it online, and even provide feedback on the paper. From now on, marking papers won't take 2 weeks for everything to be marked and lecturers can now focus on other things to improve their education rather than marking papers. The process is, instead of lecturers, reading the hard handwriting, they just need to take photo of the paper, or scan the paper, and automatically, the paper will be converted to csv files of clear texts, no more straining eyes to read the handwriting
